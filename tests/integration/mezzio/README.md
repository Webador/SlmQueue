This is a sample Mezzio project, that we set-up or testing purposes. It is configured to be able to run a single
job.

To run:

```sh
composer test
```

Note that `laminas-cli` will bootstrap the application automatically when `vendor/bin/laminas` is executed in this
directory. That is because it will find the `config/container.php` file.
