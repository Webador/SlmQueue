Documentation - Worker Management
====================

Workers are spawned by the command line but will also quit themselves automaticaly. This introduces the need to manage
these workers in an automated way.

For Linux there is a system called [supervisord](http://supervisord.org). Supervisord controls processes, will start
them automatically and restarts them when they are stopped. This part of the SlmQueue documentation does not fully
explain all features of supervisord, but it gives a kickstart for users who are in need of worker management.

Basic configuration
-------------------

Supervisord has a configuration file under `/etc/supervisord/supervisord.conf`. There you define some basic settings, 
for example logging. Under `[unix_http_server]` and `[supervisorctl]` you have to define some required fields as well:

```ini
[supervisord]
logfile          = /var/log/supervisord/supervisord.log
logfile_maxbytes = 50MB
logfile_backups  = 10
loglevel         = error

[unix_http_server]
file             = /tmp/supervisor.sock

[supervisorctl]
serverurl        = unix:///tmp/supervisor.sock
```

Worker configuration
--------------------

In supervisord, every process "group" it manages is sectioned under a `[program:x]` key. Here, `x` is the name of the 
program you want to manage. For using SlmQueue in your application, you might want to choose `my-app` as an appropriate
name.

```ini
[program:my-app]
command     = php /var/www/mysite/vendor/bin/laminas slm-queue:start default
user        = www-data
autorestart = true
```

For every program, at least the `command` line must be set, as supervisord must know which process it should manage.
Secondly, there are options to set e.g. the user under which the process will run, but there much more options available. All
options can be found at the [manual](http://supervisord.org/configuration.html) of supervisord.

When a process is killed, for example because the number of maximum runs is reached, it will exit. By default, the exit
code 0 is used. In this case, supervisord registers the killed process and starts a new process. Every time the PHP
script is stopped, supervisord makes sure a new process spawns again.

In case of an error or exception, the worker will probably be killed very soon. Supervisord checks for stop conditions
which occur within 1 second after the process started. If the process is killed within 1 second for 3 consequetive times,
supervisord stops respwaning the process. This event will be registered in the log of supervisord.

Multiple workers
----------------

When a large number of jobs are inserted into the queue, you might want to spin up more than one worker. Supervisord is 
capable of managing more processes of one program, under the key `numprocs`. Because be default, the process name is the
program name, you have to define the `process_name` as well, to distinguish the different processes.

```ini
[program:my-app]
user         = www-data
command      = php /var/www/mysite/vendor/bin/laminas slm-queue:start default
numprocs     = 3
process_name = my-app-worker-%(process_num)
autorestart  = true
```
