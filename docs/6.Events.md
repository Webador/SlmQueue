Documentation - Events
======================

As of version 0.4.0 the worker has been rewritten to a flexible event driven approach. The processing logic is now a
very minimalistic method. In pseudocode it looks like this;

```
processQueue
    trigger event 'bootstrap'

    while event says continue processing
       trigger event 'process.queue'
       trigger event 'process.job'

    trigger event 'finish'

    trigger event 'state'

```

Worker Strategies
-----------------

To get some useful results it is required to register so called 'worker strategies' to the worker. SlmQueue makes this
trivial via configuration.

Worker strategies are aggregate listeners which are created via a plugin manager.

At least one worker strategy listening to the bootstrap event must be registered to the worker. The Worker Factory will
throw an exception if its not. SlmQueue attaches the provided `AttachQueueListenersStrategy` to do just that.

It is worth noting that events will be dispatched from the worker (obviously) but can also be dispatch from within
worker strategies.

The plugin manager ensures they extend `SlmQueue\Listener\Strategy\AbstractStrategy` and each worker strategy therefore
gains the following capabilities;

### Accept options

Configuration options are passed by the plugin manager to the constructor of an worker strategy. Setter methods will be
called for each option. If a setter does not exist an exception will be thrown.

```php
'SlmQueue\Strategy\MaxRunsStrategy' => ['max_runs' => 10];
```
Such a config will result in an MaxRunsStrategy instance of which the setMaxRuns method is called with '10'.

*The optional 'priority' option is used when the aggregates listeners are are registered with event manager and is
thereafter removed from the passed options. This means a Worker Strategy cannot have this option.*

### Request to stop processing the queue

Worker strategies may inform the worker to stop processing the queue. Or more concrete; invalidate the condition of
the while loop.

```php
public function onSomeListener(WorkerEvent $event)
{
    return ExitWorkerLoopResult::withReason('an exit reason');
    ...
}
```

### Do something before or after the processing of a queue

While processing a queue it might be required to execute some setup- or teardown logic. A worker strategy may listen to
the `bootstrap` and/or `finish` event to do just this.

```php
/**
 * @param EventManagerInterface $events
 */
public function attach(EventManagerInterface $events)
{
    $this->listeners[] = $events->attach(
        WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_BOOTSTRAP,
        [$this, 'onBootstrap']
    );
    $this->listeners[] = $events->attach(
        WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_FINISH,
        [$this, 'onFinish']
    );
}

/**
 * @param BootstrapEvent $e
 */
public function onBootstrap(BootstrapEvent $e)
{
   // setup code
}

/**
 * @param FinishEvent $e
 */
public function onFinish(FinishEvent $e)
{
   // teardown code
}
```

### Do something before or after the processing of a job

For some types of jobs it might be required to do something before or after the execution of an individual job.

This can be done by listening to the `process` event at different priorities.

```php
/**
 * @param EventManagerInterface $events
 */
public function attach(EventManagerInterface $events)
{
    $this->listeners[] = $events->attach(
        WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_PROCESS_JOB,
        [$this, 'onPreProcess'],
        100
    );
    $this->listeners[] = $events->attach(
        WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_PROCESS_JOB,
        [$this, 'onPostProcess'],
        -100
    );
}

/**
 * @param ProcessJobEvent $e
 */
public function onPreProcess(ProcessJobEvent $e)
{
   // pre job execution code
}

/**
 * @param ProcessJobEvent $e
 */
public function onPostProcess(ProcessJobEvent $e)
{
   // post job execution code
}
```

### Report on 'the thing' a strategy is tasked with.

A worker strategy may report a state when th eworker exits. The strategy need to listen to 'WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_PROCESS_STATE' event. The AbstractStrategy implements a `onReportQueueState` method that takes the `$this->state` and returns it as appropiate.

From the MaxRunStrategy;

```php
public function attach(EventManagerInterface $events, $priority = 1)
{
    $this->listeners[] = $events->attach(
        WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_PROCESS_QUEUE,
        [$this, 'onStopConditionCheck'],
        -1000
    );
    $this->listeners[] = $events->attach(
        WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_PROCESS_STATE,
        [$this, 'onReportQueueState'],
        $priority
    );
}


public function onStopConditionCheck(WorkerEvent $event)
{
    $this->runCount++;

    $this->state = sprintf('%s jobs processed', $this->runCount);
}
```

### Dispatch WorkerEvents

A worker strategy may ask the worker to dispatch events.

From the ProcessQueueStrategy

```php
public function onJobPop(ProcessQueueEvent $processQueueEvent)
{
    /** @var AbstractWorker $worker */
    $worker       = $processQueueEvent->getTarget();
    $queue        = $processQueueEvent->getQueue();
    $options      = $processQueueEvent->getOptions();
    $eventManager = $worker->getEventManager();

    $job          = $queue->pop($options);

    // The queue may return null, for instance if a timeout was set
    if (!$job instanceof JobInterface) {
        /** @var ResponseCollection $results */
        $results = $eventManager->triggerEventUntil(
            function ($response) {
                return $response instanceof ExitWorkerLoopResult;
            },
            new ProcessIdleEvent($worker, $queue)
        );

        $processQueueEvent->stopPropagation();

        if ($results->stopped()) {
            return $results->last();
        }

        return;
    }

    $eventManager->triggerEvent(new ProcessJobEvent($job, $worker, $queue));
}
```

Configuration
-------------


Services
--------

Worker strategies are regular ZF2 services that are instanciated via a plugin manager. If a worker strategy has
dependancies on other services it should be created it via service factory.

**The plugin manager is configured to *not* share services.**

WorkerEvent
-----------

Events the worker *and* worker strategies may dispatch;

 * `WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_BOOTSTRAP` just before loop is entered
 * `WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_FINISH` just after the loop has exited
 * `WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_PROCESS_QUEUE` fetch job(s)
 * `WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_PROCESS_JOB` processes job(s)
 * `WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_PROCESS_IDLE` when the queue is empty
 * `WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_PROCESS_STATE` collects 'states' from strategies.

A listener waiting for above events will be passed a an event class extending `WorkerEvent`. Depending on the type it might contain additional methods, such as getJob or getQueue.

```php
$em->attach(WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_PROCESS_JOB, function(ProcessJobEvent $e) {
    $queue = $e->getQueue();
    $job   = $e->getJob();
});
```

In above example, `$em` refers to the event manager inside the worker object: `$em = $worker->getEventManager();`.

Job status codes
----------------

When a job is processed, the [job or worker returns a status code](3.Jobs.md#job-status-codes). You
can use a listener to act upon this status, for example to log any failed jobs:

```php
$logger = $sm->get('logger');
$em->attach(WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_PROCESS_JOB, function(ProcessJobEvent $e) use ($logger) {
    $result = $e->getResult();
    if (ProcessJobEvent::JOB_STATUS_FAILURE === $result) {
        $job = $e->getJob();
        $logger->warn(sprintf(
            'Job #%s (%s) failed executing', $job->getId(), get_class($job)
        ));
    }
}, -1000);
```

Provided Worker Strategies
--------------------------

#### AttachQueueListenersStrategy

The purpose of this strategy is to register additional strategies that are specific to the queue that is being
processed.

After registering any additional worker strategies it will unregister itself as a listener. Finally it halts the event
propagation and re-triggers the `bootstrap` event.

A new cycle of bootstraping will occure but now with additional queue specific strategies.

listens to:

- `bootstrap` event at priority PHP_MAX_INT

triggers:

- `bootstrap`

throws:

- RunTimeException if the `process.queue` event isn't listened to by any registered strategy.

This strategy is enabled by default for all queue's.

#### FileWatchStrategy

This strategy is able to 'watch' files by creating a hash of their contents. If it detects a change it will request to
stop processing the queue. This is useful if you have something like [supervisor](7.WorkerManagement.md) automatically
restarting the worker process.

The strategy builds a list of files it needs to watch via a preg_match on the filenames within the application.

listens to:

- `process.idle` event at priority 1
- `process.job` event at priority 1000
- `process.state` event at priority 1

options:

- pattern defaults to `'/^\.\/(config|module).*\.(php|phtml)$/'`
- idle_throttle_time defaults to 300 seconds

This strategy is not enabled by default. It can be slow and is recommended for development only. In production you may
watch a single file. It will run the check before each job and while idling after `idle_throttle_time` seconds
have passed.

#### InterruptStrategy

The InterruptStrategy is able to catch a stop condition under Linux-like systems (as well as OS X). If a worker is
started from the command line interface (CLI), it is possible to send a SIGTERM or SiGINT call to the worker. SlmQueue
is smart enough not to quit the script directly, but let the job finish its work first and then break out of the loop.
On Windows systems this strategy does nothing.

listens to:

- `process.idle` event at priority 1
- `process.queue` event at priority -1000
- `process.state` event at priority 1

This strategy is enabled by default for all queue's.

#### MaxMemoryStrategy

The MaxMemoryStrategy will measure the amount of memory allocated to PHP after each processed job. It will request to
exit when a threshold is exceeded.

Note that an individual job may exceed this threshold during it's live time. But if you have a memory leak this strategy
can make sure the script aborts eventually.

listens to:

- `process.idle` event at priority 1
- `process.queue` event at priority -1000
- `process.state` event at priority 1

options:

- max_memory defaults to 100\*1024\*1024

This strategy is enabled by default for all queue's.

#### MaxRunsStrategy

The MaxRunsStrategy will request to exit after a set number of jobs have been processed.

listens to:

- `process.idle` event at priority 1
- `process.job` event at priority -1000
- `process.state` event at priority 1

options:

- max_runs defaults to 100000

This strategy is enabled by default for all queue's.

#### WorkerLifetimeStrategy

The `WorkerLifetimeStrategy` will request to exit the worker if a given lifetime was reached or exceeded.

The configured lifetime is NOT a hard-cap for the actual runtime of the worker, because no jobs will be killed during
their execution. It is more like a soft-cap because the check for exiting is only between jobs
(while idling and at the start of a new job).

So if a worker with a short lifetime (e. g. 1 hour) starts a long running job (e. g. 2 hours) it will
exit after the execution of the job.

listens to:

- `bootstrap` event at priority 1: sets the start time
- `process.queue` event at priority -1000: exits if the lifetime was exceeded
- `process.idle` event at priority -1000: exits if the lifetime was exceeded
- `process.state` event at priority 1: returns the current state of the strategy

options:

- `lifetime`: the softcap of the worker lifetime in seconds, defaults to 3600 seconds (1 hour)

#### ProcessQueueStrategy

Responsible for quering the queue for jobs and executing them.

listens to:

- `process.queue` event at priority 1
- `process.job` event at priority 1

triggers:

- `process.job` for each job pop'ed from the queue
- `process.idle` if the queue returns null (it might be empty or timed out)

#### MaxPollingFrequencyStrategy

The MaxPollingFrequencyStrategy ensure the polling frequency don't exceed a
defined value. This can be useful in the case where you are using a system like
SQS which makes you pay the service per request.

listens to:

- `process.queue` event at priority 1000

options:

- max_frequency

This strategy is not enabled by default.

##### Frequency - Time per unit table

| Frequency | x / sec | x / min | x / hour | x / day | x / month |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | --------- |
| 0.1       | 0.1     | 6       | 360      | 8640    | 259200    |
| 0.2       | 0.2     | 12      | 720      | 17280   | 518400    |

##### Add the strategy to you worker

In the SlmQueue config, find the part named `worker_strategies` and add the
following line:

```php
'SlmQueue\Strategy\MaxPollingFrequencyStrategy' => ['max_frequency' => 1]
```

Replace the `max_frequency` value helping you with the tables above.

Using the shared event manager
------------------------------

Instead of direct access to the worker's event manager, the shared manager is available to register events too:

```php
<?php
namespace MyModule;

use SlmQueue\Worker\WorkerEvent;
use Laminas\Mvc\MvcEvent;

class Module
{
    public function onBootstrap(MvcEvent $e)
    {
        $em       = $e->getApplication()->getEventManager();
        $sharedEm = $em->getSharedManager();

        $sharedEm->attach('SlmQueue\Worker\WorkerInterface', WorkerEvent::EVENT_PROCESS_JOB, function() {
            // some thing just before a job starts.
        }, 1000);
    }
}
```

Note: since v1.0.1 we have decoupled from laminas/laminas-mvc and as such the shared event manager isn't available in the service container. If you are not using laminas-mvc you should not use the shared event manager.

Note: we will probably move away from the shared event manager for a next major release. We recommend that if you need to subscribe to events to use the worker's event manager `SlmQueue\Worker\AbstractWorker::getEventManager()`.

```php
<?php
namespace MyModule;

use SlmQueue\Worker\WorkerEvent;
use Laminas\Mvc\MvcEvent;

class Module
{
    public function onBootstrap(MvcEvent $e)
    {
        $sm     = $e->getApplication()->getServiceLocator();
        $worker = $sm->get('\SlmQueueDoctrine\Worker\DoctrineWorker');
        $em     = $worker->getEventManager();

        $em->attach(WorkerEvent::EVENT_PROCESS_JOB, function() {
            // some thing just before a job starts.
        }, 1000);
    }
}
```

An example
----------

A good example is i18n: a job is given a locale if the job performs localized actions. This locale is set to the
translator just before processing starts. The original locale is reverted when the job has finished processing.

In this case, all jobs which require a locale set are implementing a `LocaleAwareInterface`:

```php
<?php

namespace MyModule\Job;

interface LocaleAwareInterface
{
    /**
     * @param string $locale
     */
    public function setLocale($locale);

    /**
     * @return string
     */
    public function getLocale();
}
```

An worker strategy will listen for two events to set and revert the locale:

```php
<?php
namespace MyModule\Strategy;

use MyModule\Job\LocaleAwareInterface;
use SlmQueue\Listener\Strategy\AbstractStrategy;
use SlmQueue\Worker\WorkerEvent;
use Laminas\EventManager\EventManagerInterface;
use Laminas\I18n\Translator\Translator;

class JobTranslatorStrategy extends AbstractStrategy
{
    /**
     * @var Stores original locale while processing a Job
     */
    protected $locale;

    /**
     * @var Instance of Translator
     */
    protected $translator;

    /**
     * @param Translator $translator
     */
    public function __construct(Translator $translator)
    {
        $this->translator = $translator;
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     */
    public function attach(EventManagerInterface $events)
    {
        $this->listeners[] = $events->attach(WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_PROCESS_JOB, [$this, 'onPreJobProc'], 1000);
        $this->listeners[] = $events->attach(WorkerEventInterface::EVENT_PROCESS_JOB, [$this, 'onPostJobProc'], -1000);
    }

    public function onPreJobProcessing(ProcessJobEvent $e)
    {
        $job = $e->getJob();

        if (!$job instanceof LocaleAwareInterface) {
            return;
        }

        $this->locale = $this->translator->getLocale();
        $this->translator->setLocale($job->getLocale());
    }

    public function onPostJobProcessing(ProcessJobEvent $e)
    {
        $job = $e->getJob();

        if (!$job instanceof LocaleAwareInterface) {
            return;
        }

        $this->translator->setLocale($this->locale);
    }
}
```

Since this worker strategy has a dependency that needs to be injected we should create a factory for it.

```php
<?php
namespace MyModule\Strategy\Factory;

use MyModule\Strategy\JobTranslatorStrategy;
use Laminas\ServiceManager\Factory\FactoryInterface;
use Laminas\ServiceManager\ServiceLocatorInterface;

class JobTranslatorStrategyFactory implements FactoryInterface
{
    public function __invoke(ContainerInterface $container, $requestedName, array $options = null)
    {
        $sm = $container->getServiceLocator();

        /** @var $sm \Laminas\Mvc\I18n\Translator */
        $translator = $sm->get('MvcTranslator');

        $strategy = new JobTranslatorStrategy($translator);

        return $strategy;
    }
}
```

Finally add two configuration settings;

 1. Register the factory to the plugin manager to the Strategy Manager.
 2. Add the strategy by name to the worker strategies. Note we can do this for all queue's or for specific ones.

```php
<?php
return [
    'slm_queue' => [
        /**
         * Worker Strategies
         */
        'worker_strategies' => [
            'default' => [ // per worker
                // add it here to enable the
            ],
            'queues' => [ // per queue
                'my-queue' => [
                    'MyModule\Strategy\JobTranslatorStrategy',
                ]
            ],
        ],

        /**
         * Strategy manager
         */
        'strategy_manager' => [
            'factories' => [
                'MyModule\Strategy\JobTranslatorStrategy' => 'MyModule\Strategy\Factory\JobTranslatorStrategyFactory',
            ]
        ],
    ]
];

```
